# [Project 1: Student-Performance Analysis](https://github.com/Priyanshi2205/Student-Performance---Machine-Learning)

This project aims to analyze and predict the academic performance of students based on various factors such as demographics, social-economic status, study habits, and personal attributes.The best-performing model is then used to predict the academic performance of new students based on their attributes. 

Overall, the project aims to leverage the power of machine learning to provide a data-driven approach to student performance analysis and enable better decision-making in education.

* **Models :** KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes.

# [Project 2: Online Food Order Prediction](https://github.com/Priyanshi2205/Online-Food-Ordering-Prediction)

Developed a predictive model to determine whether customers would order food when they visited a website. Provided insights and recommendations to improve the website's user experience and increase food ordering rates

* **Models :** KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes.

# [Project 3: Customer Segmentation - RFM Analysis](https://github.com/Priyanshi2205/Customer-Segmentation---RFM-Analysis)

Analyzed the recency, frequency, and monetary value of customer purchases to determine their segment. Implemented and maintained the RFM analysis process for ongoing customer segmentation.

* **Model used :** Hierarchical Clustering.

# [Project 4: Web Scrapping of Imdb Data](https://github.com/Priyanshi2205/Web-Scrapping-using-python-BeautifulSoup-)

Data scraping is the first step in any data analytics project. It involves pulling data (usually from the web) and compiling it into a usable format. While thereâ€™s no shortage of great data repositories available online, scraping and cleaning data yourself is a great way to show off your skills. 
This project contains scraped data from websites using Python Beautiful Soup library. Extracted specific information from web pages, such as product prices or contact information. Cleaned and formatted the data for further analysis or integration into other systems.
In this project data of movies have been scraped from the Imdb website of first 1000 best movies using python.

# [Project 5: Data Professionals Survey Dashboard Using Power BI](https://github.com/Priyanshi2205/Power-Bi-Projects/blob/main/Data%20Professional%20Survey%20Analysis.pdf)

The "Data Professionals Survey Dashboard" Power BI project is a visual representation of the survey results collected from data professionals.

The project involves collecting data from the survey, which includes various aspects related to data professionals such as their job roles, experience, education, industry, and job satisfaction levels. The data is then cleaned, processed, and transformed into a format that can be easily visualized using Power BI.
