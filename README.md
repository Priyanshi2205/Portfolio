In this project I have applied various Machine Learning Models on the student Dataset in which the model gets trained with the old performance of student and predict the performance if new student.
* **Models :** KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes.

This is a project which suggests the best model to predict in future that the customer arising on the website will order the food or not. In this project, I have tried to predict with the existing data whether the customer will order the food or not when they visit the website.
* **Models :** KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes.

The main objective of this project is to segment the target customers given on the basis of  different customers  behaviors and features, in order for the company to be able to market for each segment in a manner that is more fitting to each individual customer.
* **Model used :** Hierarchical Clustering.

Data scraping is the first step in any data analytics project. It involves pulling data (usually from the web) and compiling it into a usable format. While thereâ€™s no shortage of great data repositories available online, scraping and cleaning data yourself is a great way to show off your skills.

In this project I have scrapped the movies data from the Imdb website of first 1000 best movies using python.
